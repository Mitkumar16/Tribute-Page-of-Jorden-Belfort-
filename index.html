            selling Italian ice</i> from styrofoam coolers to people at a local beach.Belfort went on to graduate from
          American University with a degree in biology.Belfort planned on using the money earned with Loewenstern to pay
          for dental school,and he enrolled at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry.However, the dean of the
          dental school gave a welcoming speech on the first day in which he said <b> "The golden age of dentistry is

        <h3>Biographies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Early ventures: <br>
            Belfort became a door-to-door meat and seafood salesman on Long Island, New York. He claims in interviews
            and his memoirs that the business was an initial success; he grew his meat-selling business to employ
            several workers and sell 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms) of beef and fish a week. The business ultimately
            failed, as he filed for bankruptcy at 25.

            According to his memoirs and interviews, a family friend helped him find a job as a trainee <b>
              stockbroker</b> at L.F. Rothschild. Belfort says he was laid off after that firm experienced financial
            difficulties related to the <b> Black Monday</b> stock market crash of 1987.
          </li>

          <li>
            Stratton Oakmont: <br>

            Stratton Oakmont functioned as a boiler room that marketed penny stocks and defrauded investors
            with "pump and dump" stock sales.Stratton Oakmont at one point employed over 1,000 stock
            brokers and was involved in stock issues totaling more than <b> $1 billion</b>, including being behind the
            initial
            public offering for footwear company Steve Madden. The firm was targeted by law enforcement officials
            throughout nearly its entire history, and its notoriety inspired the film Boiler Room (2000),as well as
            the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). <br>
            Belfort stated:
            I got greedy. ... Greed is not good. Ambition is good, passion is good. Passion prospers. My goal is to give
            more than I get, that's a sustainable form of success. ... Ninety-five per cent of the business was
            legitimate. ... It was all brokerage firm issues. It was all legitimate, nothing to do with liquidating
            stocks.

          </li>

          <li>
            Restitution : <br>
            Belfort's restitution agreement required him to pay 50% of his income towards restitution to the 1,513
            clients he defrauded until 2009, with a total of $110 million in restitution further mandated. About $10
            million of the $110 million that had been recovered by Belfort's victims as of 2013 was the result of the
            sale of forfeited properties.
            <br>BusinessWeek reported that Belfort had paid only <b> $21,000</b> toward his restitution obligations out
            of approximately <b>$1.2 million</b> paid to him in connection with the film before its release.Belfort has
            stated that the government refused his offer to put 100% of his book deal money towards his restitution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Writing: <br>
            Belfort wrote the two memoirs The Wolf of Wall Street and Catching the Wolf of Wall Street which have been
            published in approximately <b> 40 countries and translated into 18 languages</b>.A film based on his books
            opened in 2013 starring Leonardo DiCaprio (as Belfort), Jonah Hill, and Margot Robbie; the film was written
            by Terence Winter and directed by Martin Scorsese.

            Motivational speaking: <br>
            Belfort in 2010
            Belfort has given motivational speeches.This has included a tour of live seminars in Australia
            entitled "The Truth Behind His Success", in addition to other appearances. In a 60 Minutes interview
            regarding his new career, Belfort stated of his previous life that his "greatest regret is losing people's
            money".He also runs sales seminars entitled "Jordan Belfort's Straight Line Sales
            Psychology".When he first began speaking, he focused largely on motivation and ethics, then moved his
            focus to sales skills and entrepreneurship. <br>

            His speaking engagements are run through his business Global Motivation Inc. and, as of 2014, Belfort was
            spending three weeks out of each month on the road for speaking engagements. The main theme of his speeches
            includes the importance of business ethics and learning from the mistakes that he made during the 1990s—such
            as believing that he was justified in skirting the rules of financial regulators simply because it was a
            common thing to do.His per-engagement speaking fees have been about <b>$30,000–75,000 and his per sales
              seminar fee can be $80,000 or more.</b> <br>

            The main subject matter of his seminars is what he has called "Straight Line System", a system of sales
            advice.

            Politics: <br>
            In the 1990s, Belfort donated $100,000 to the Republican Party and $2,000 to Al D'Amato's reelection
            campaign in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Despite calling himself <i> "a liberal at
              heart"</i>, with "social views are liberal; abortion and stuff like that," Belfort said that in the run-up
            to the 2016 United States presidential election, he "became very pro-Trump . . . . And then when I saw what
            happened after he won, I was like‚ 'this country is worse that I thought!' There's obviously such a problem
            with the liberals, I'd never seen anything like it." Ultimately Belfort voted for Donald Trump because he
            agreed with Trump on government size and immigration policy. Despite his support for Trump he has also
            acknowledged that Trump's rhetoric is divisive. During the 2020 Democratic primaries, he criticized Bernie
            Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for policy proposals that would affect financial institutions, saying "What
            frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is the answer
            but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country".
